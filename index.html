   <h1><u>All About Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science for Year 2, Semister 1 in UPNG</u></h1>
   <p>The department of Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science is under the School of Natural and
   physical Science in the University of Papua New Guinea. The Bachelor of Science in Computer Science
   Statistics Program provides a strong technical foundation for students interested in persuing
   graduate-level studies in computer science. In addition to the core cirriculum, the program covers
   the fundimentals of network, programming, software engineering and statistics. The Bacholor of
   Science in Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science is a three-year degree programme which
   provides a strong foundation in Matheatics, Statistics and Programming. Students who graduate
   with this degree can apply for careers in the IT scctor, particularly in Programming and Software
   Engineering. Some of the main area of employment graduates with degreee in Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science enter are; finance,industry, computing(including operational reseach),Management,administration, statictics, teaching(schools and collages) and post graduate study.
   and many more. The second year students of mathematics, statistics and computer science study four
   major courses
   in the first semister at UPNG. The link here shows more information about the courses the MSCS division offers
   <a href="https://www.upng.ac.pg">Click the link</a> . These four courses are; Information Technology Concepts, Calculus 1,
   Discrete Mathematics and Linear Algebra.
   There are only six girls taking MSCS and the majority of the year two students are all boys.
